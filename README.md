### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data


### Description
project is based on "Motivate" data, a Bikeshare system used in some of the largest cities in the United States. I will use data from three cities: New York City, Washington and Chicago. The task of this project is to analyze the data of these cities and allow the user to filter the results by city (mandatory), month, day or not to filter them at all. It is an interactive question-answering experience and if the user makes an input error when for example he has to enter the city, the program does not stop but will continue to ask for the correct input. The data that can be displayed are the following :
1. __Popular times of travel:__
    * most common month
    * most common day of week
    * most common hour of day
2. __Popular stations and trip:__
    * most common start station
    * most common end station
    * most common trip from start to end
3. __Trip duration:__
    * total travel time
    * average travel time
4. __User info:__
    * counts of each user type
    * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
